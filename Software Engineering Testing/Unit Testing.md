- Modular programming is necessary. Dividing code into smaller parts.
- Checking each part/ class and check if it is working correctly.
- A good naming convention is to start naming the test file with "test_". Example : "test_math_func.py" is the test file for testing "math_func.py".
- Inside the test file, each function name should start with "test_". Example : "test_add" for testing the "add" function.
For python we can use [[pytest]].
