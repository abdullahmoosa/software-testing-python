Software Testing is essential for developing the final product. It is essential to understand whether the final product is the "right one" or "the product is working right".

"Right one" means whether the product satisfies the customer requirement.

"The product working right" means whether the product is working correctly without any bugs.
Two types of testing :
- [[Functional Testing]]
- [[Non-Functional Testing]]

[[Unit Testing]] is used to check if each class of the codebase is working. 

Integration Testing is used to check if the software as a whole is working as intended.

System testing is used to check if the overall software is working without any issues after deployment.

Acceptance Testing is used to check if the final product matches with the customer requirement.


**As a software developer, it is essential to design the "unit tests" to check if each class is working properly.**
